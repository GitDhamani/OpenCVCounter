OpenCV Vehicle and Pedestrian Counter with QT C++

The motion of objects is identified frame by frame using the OpenCV Library. Integrating it with QT and C++ means countours of motion can be identified and drawn directly on the frame with bounding rectangles. A Gaussian blur filter is implemented to also help reduce pixelation noise. In this example I'm keeping an on screen count of any objects or pedestrians that cross the central dividing line.
